Strings have an <strong>attribute</strong> (feature) called 'length'. All you have to do is tag it after the string / variable.

    var str1 = "Hello";
    var length1 = str1.length; // This is 5
    
    var length2 = " Camper".length; // This is 7, the space is considered as one space

As a bonus fact, strings are what are known as <strong>objects</strong>. Objects have attributes; one of the attributes of a string object, is its length! You will learn more about objects in upcoming lessons.
