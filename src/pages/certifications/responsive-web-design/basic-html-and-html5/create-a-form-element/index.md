## Create a Form Element

To use a form is a neat method to gather infomation directly from the user input. When you use this HTML element you are identifying a section devoted to collect the user choices.

Inside this HTML element generally you might insert at least few `input` tag, used to collect data in different ways based on the `type` attribute.

All these data will be sent to the page indicated in the `action` attribute of the form: a relative path that indicates the position of the page that will expect those data.

In this challenge you already have an `input` element, you just need to wrap a `form` tag around it: do not forget the `action` attribute, set as indicated by the challenge ( doublecheck the syntax).

Good luck!
