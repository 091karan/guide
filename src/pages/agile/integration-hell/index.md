## Integration Hell

Integration Hell is a slang term for when all the members of a development team goes through the process of implementing their code at random times with no way to incorporate the different pieces of code into one seamless sring of code. The development team will have to spend several hours or days testing and tweaking the code to get it all to work.

Continuous Integration, the idea that a development team should use specific tools to "continously integrate" the parts of the code they are working on multiple times a day so that the tools can match the different "chunks" of code together to integrate much more seamlessly than before.

Code Repositories, like Git (and it's open source interface we all know and love, GitHub) allow development teams to organize their efforts so that more time can be spent coding and less time on worrying if the different parts of the code will all integrate.
