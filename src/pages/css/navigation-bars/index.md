## Navigation Bars

A Navigation Bar helps users go to a specific page of the site. Navigation Bars are mostly made up of `<ul>` lists that are horizontally arranged and styled.

While styling the navigation bars, it's common to remove the extra spacing created by the `<ul>` and `<li>` tags as well as the bulletpoints that are automatically inserted:

```css
   list-style-type: none;
   margin: 0px;
   padding: 0px;
```
